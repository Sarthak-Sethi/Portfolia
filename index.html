          <h3>Intelligent-Post-Lock-Down-Management-System-for-Public-Transportation</h3>
          <img src="images/project1.jpeg" alt="image for project 1 Lock-Down-Management-System-for-Public-Transportation">
          <p>The proposal is to make a mobile application to manage post lock down public transportation. During this pandemic the major risk for the spread can be through the use of public transports ,the application will provide an effective solution for the passengers to board a train at railway . Our idea is to schedule the timing of passengers arrival on the basis of their ticket class , for instance we can have a nominal gap in the arrival time of passengers of the 3.Ac, 2.AC</p>

          <h3>BookDo - Start Living Your Books</h3>

          <img src="images/project3.png" alt="image for project 3">
          <p>We convert a book's teachings, insights & knowledge into bite-size principles accompanied with a task or as we like to call it -Actionables- for you, so that you not only get the gist of the book but also live your books by practical application of those principles.
The principles are curated in such a way so that you are able to understand these principles followed by a task. You will be given certain steps on how to complete the task. In this way, you can start living your book, in 10-30 minutes of your time of your daily routine by completing one task at a time i.e. one principle/ one task a day.</p>
